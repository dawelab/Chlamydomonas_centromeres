Chlamydomonas UL1690 Genome Analysis Pipeline

ðŸ§¬ Genome Assembly

	â€¢ Laboratory strains UL-1690 (a derivative of CC-1690/21gr) and CC-400 (cw15) were selected for PacBio HiFi sequencing.
	â€¢ Genome assemblies were generated using HiFiasm.
	â€¢ RagTag was used to correct assembly errors and generate pseudochromosomes.
 
ðŸ§¬ Gene Annotation

	â€¢ Gene models in UL-1690 were annotated based on the GFF3 file of reference strain CC-4532.
	â€¢ Liftoff v1.6.3 was used to transfer annotations from CC-4532 to the UL-1690 assembly.
	â€¢ The longest isoform per gene was retained using AGAT, supporting visualization in IGV and gene density calculation.
 
ðŸ§¬ Tandem Repeats Identification

	â€¢ TRF (Tandem Repeats Finder) was used to annotate tandem repeats across four laboratory strains.
 
ðŸ“Œ ZeppL-LINE1 Enrichment Analysis

	â€¢ ZeppL_Crei.fa was used as the query for BLASTN searches to identify ZeppL fragments in all genomes.
	â€¢ Fragments < 300 bp and with < 90% identity were filtered out.
	â€¢ ZeppL-enriched regions along chromosomes were identified using BEDTools, with 40 kb intervals.
 
ðŸ“Œ Centromere Estimation

	â€¢ CENH3 CUT&Tag reads were processed as follows:
	      Adapter trimming: TrimGalore v0.6.7.
	      Genome alignment: Bowtie2 v2.4.5.
	â€¢ Mapping strategies:
	      Multiple + unique mapping: used to estimate upper bounds of CENH3 enrichment.
	      Unique-only mapping (MAPQ â‰¥ 20): used to estimate lower bounds of CENH3 enrichment.
	â€¢ Normalization & visualization:
	      BAMs converted to bedgraph and BED using BEDTools.
	      Per-bin (5 kb) read depth and fold enrichment computed and visualized with karyoploteR in R.
       
ðŸ“Š R Code & Plotting

	â€¢ All R scripts for generating plots are included.
	â€¢ All key input data files are provided.
